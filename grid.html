     <div>Specifies the track list as a series of track sizing functions and line names. Each track sizing function can be specified as a length, a percentage of the grid containerâ€™s size, a measurement of the contents occupying the column or row, or a fraction of the free space in the grid. It can also be specified as a range using the minmax() notation, which can combine any of the previously mentioned mechanisms to specify separate min and max track sizing functions for the column or row.</div>
